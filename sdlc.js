/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning
1. Planning
2.Analysis of Requirements
3.Design
4.Implementation
5.Testing & Integration
6.Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "this is the second step, in which all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes."
const design = "This is the third step, Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects."
const implementation = "This is the forth step, where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications and requirments."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where developers will go over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, where developers must now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users."
